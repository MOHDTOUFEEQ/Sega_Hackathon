ðŸŽ¯ JS Libraries That Can Help
You can do it all from scratch, but here are libraries that can speed up development:

1. PixiJS
A fast 2D rendering engine built for games.

Great if you want better performance, sprite handling, and effects.

Makes canvas easier to work with.

Example use: Loading sprite sheets, handling animation frames, camera movement, etc.

2. Howler.js
For handling audio (background music, gunfire, explosions).

Simple, powerful, and cross-browser.

3. GSAP
For animations, like UI transitions, enemy entrances, power-up effects.

Smooth and flexible.

4. Matter.js (optional)
A physics engine. If you want platforms, gravity, collision detection, etc.

May be overkill if youâ€™re doing simpler bounding box collisions though.
